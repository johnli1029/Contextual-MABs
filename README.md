# Contextual-MABs

In this repo, a series of non-contextual and contextual MABs(Multi-arms 
Bandits) are implemented by python in forms of Jupyter notenook, which 
is based on interactive python interface IPython.

This is a just repo used for version control, given the limited 
checking point feature provided by notebook.
